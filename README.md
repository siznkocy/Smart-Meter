# Embedded-Projects | Smart Meter

The following files contains a demostration video content to show the workings the designed smart-meter.
The code was developed using atmel-studio for "atmega16/32".

 To rebuild the code "main.c" the keypad (keypad.h and keypad.c ) files must be included in the project folder.
 The file "TESTING.pdsprj" is the simulation ran from "proteus".
 
 The list of software used: 	
 	
	1. Atmel Studio 7 https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/avr-and-sam-downloads-archive 
	2. Proteus 8 Professional.
    
    
To run the project on your PC. please follow these below steps: 

    1. Download the files from the this hub.
    2. Create "Smart-meter" folder and place the files downloaded in the created folder.
    3. Open "Atmel 7", and Protues 8 professional.
    3. on Atmel 7 **create** a new project, and choose a package **"atmega16/32".**
    4. Build/Compile the code. which will yeild "main.hex" file.
    5. Now  on **Protues 8** open "TESTING.pdsprj" only version from 8 and above is compatible to open the **pdsprj** file.
    6. use the  **main.hex** file to sort of progamm the chip on **Proteus**.
