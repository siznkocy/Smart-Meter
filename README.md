# Embedded-Projects

The following files contains a demostration video content to show the working of the smart-meter.
The code was developed using atmel-studio for "atmega16/32".

 To rebuild the code "main.c" the keypad (keypad.h and keypad.c ) files must be included in the project folder.
 The file "TESTING.pdsprj" is the simulation ran from "proteus".
 
 the list of software used: 
    1. Atmel Studio 7
    2. Proteus 8 Professional
    
    
To run the project on your PC. Steps are: 
    1. dowload the files from the this hub
    2. create a folder and place them there.
    3. make sure to choose the atmega 16/32 package in the case of copy & paste.
    4. build/compile the code. which will yeild "main.hex" file. 
    5. open "TESTING.pdsprj" on "Protues 8" or above.
    6. use the hex file to sort of progamm the chip.
    7. run the simulations. wala the code run.
